I've been testing out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo") for a few days and finding I enjoy the experience. I'm writing about my current workflow as a new user. Documenting my early workflow could be worthwhile as I may adjust over time.

## The tools

I am using the following applications and they're a matter of personal preference.

* Vim: Text Editor
* i3wm: Window Manager
* Firefox

That's it. Actually this list could simply bit I use Vim and leave it at that. However, I have found that my enjoyment of using a text editor increases when I'm using the i3 tiling window manager. Additionally, Firefox plays a part in my development process via its built in developer tools.

## Vim

Text editors for any developer is personal. I started using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/ "Vim") out of curiosity soon realizing that with its become my standout favorite. Partly, due to its own workflow of using commands instead mousing around menus. In a single short text command I can set up my editor for writing.

	:set spell wrap linebreak

This short command turns on the spellcheck, wraps text by linebreak so I don't end up with partial words running off the editor. 

The minimalism of distraction free editing experience paired with instantaneous on screen feedback as I type can't be understated. I simply enjoy technology when it becomes fluid and gets out of my way.

### Markdown

Before Hugo I only gave [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax") a passing glance. Once I got a hang of it becomes almost an transparent writing experience. Markdown syntax HTML look clunky and overcomplicated.

## i3wm

When I started spending more time in bash shell and the terminal A traditional window manager like Windows, Mac OS, XFCE and GNOME felt inefficient. With a tiling window manager such as [i3](https://i3wm.org/ "i3 Window Manager") we can efficiently and dynamically dock them with a few keystrokes. On a single desktop or several, In most cases I stopped using stopped a mouse and trackpad. They become the tool of last resort. 

## Firefox

Simply put, I prefer [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ "Firefox web browser") to any other browser. I've been using it for years and baring some disaster I'll probably be using it for many more to come.

I'm not sure where Hugo will take me but I appreciate the lightweight and distraction free writing experience I've discovered as a result.
