Somehow I expected installing hugo to be a more difficult process than it actually was. Sure getting my system ready took at most an hour but the [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ "Quick Start") guide covered everything nearly perfectly.

Ubuntu threw up a few messages for dependencies not metioned in that guide however, that's to be expected. Once I followed those prompts everything was ready. This is actually the second time I've installed it on a system so I knew what to expect.

Kinda wish we had static site generators 20 years ago.
