I'm amused this domain name was available. This morning I searched for a project domain to test out the [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/ "Hugo web framework") static-site generator framework and came across the relatively cheap .space domain at [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com "namecheap domain registrar"). Naturally all the generic terms were taken. Battlestar Galatica's frak wasn't available, but frell was. As a frelling fan of Farscape I couldn't pass it up.

## What the Frell

Frell is an Sebacean word created as a substitute fuck, shit and similar banned words on for US television.

### Popular usage includes

"Frell Off"

"Frell You"

"Merry Frelling Christmas"

"I am not Kirk, Spock, Luke, Buck, Flash, or Arthur frelling Dent. I am Dorothy Gale from Kansas."

**Welcome to my Frelling blog you filthy dren.**
