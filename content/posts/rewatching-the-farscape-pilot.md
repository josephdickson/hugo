While plugging along in Hugo I decided to give the Farscape pilot a watch. 

It's been twenty years since John Crichton's Farscape One was caught in a wormhole attempting to use earth's mass to slingshot somewhere... Beyond earth orbit. Unfortunately, the writers didn't provide any more details than a half minute of bland dialog.

Once we find ourselves beyond earth and Space Shuttle Discovery file footage things start to get interesting. Any more time spent on earth might just make me consider swallowing a dentic to avoid another minute. 

Aside from the rough late nineties CGI the show holds up fairly well thanks to its comedic approach and solid casting with Ben Browder and Claudia Black. 

If you're curious [Farscape is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07PNDDZGY/ "Farscape atn Amazon")
